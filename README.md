The **FindMyClothes** API is an AI-powered app, specifically designed to interactively and effectively improve users online shopping experience.

## **Features**
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes OpenAI to extract and analyze clothing details from HTML.
- **Web Scraping:** Automates the retrieval of product details using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
- **Google Search Integration:** Leverages Google Search for finding product links and store locations.
- **Image Analysis:** Converts images to base64 and integrates with OpenAI for clothing analysis.
- **Localization Support:** Detects user's location to suggest nearby stores.

## skills I managed to use in this project:
- **webscraping with the use of *Selenium* and *BeatifulSoup***
- **usage of LLM model like *openai* for image recognition and extracted html code analysis**
- **usage of external API like *google search***
-
